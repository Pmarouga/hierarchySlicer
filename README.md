# Power BI HierachySlicer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liprec/powerbi-hierarchySlicer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liprec/powerbi-hierarchySlicer)

Home for my Power BI Custom Visual: HierarchySlicer

This visual is still using the legacy API and *not* a good example on how to create custom slicers for Power BI.

## Build

First run NPM to gather all the needed build packages
```
npm nstall
```

Then run the following two gulp build commands to generate the `.pbiviz` file:
```
gulp build
gulp package
```

## Support

If you need any support related to this visual, feel free to create an issue and describe what the problem in. If you can add a sample PBIX file with, that would help me a lot.
